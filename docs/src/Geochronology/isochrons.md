# Isochrons

Isochrons are lines on a map that connect points of equal age.
They are used in geochronology to determine the absolute ages of rocks and minerals.

The most commonly used method for creating isochrons is often referred to as the *York* method.
This is based on the [YorkEtAl2004](@citet) paper, which describes a statistical method
for fitting affine regression to data with errors in both x and y.
