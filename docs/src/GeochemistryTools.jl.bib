  abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Plots of chondrite-normalised rare earth element (REE) patterns often appear as smooth curves. These curves can be decomposed into orthogonal polynomial functions (shape components), each of which captures a feature of the total pattern. The coefficients of these components (known as the lambda coefficients---                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$                                        {$\lambda$}                                                                  ) can be derived using least-squares fitting, allowing quantitative description of REE patterns and dimension reduction of parameters required for this. The tetrad effect is similarly quantified using least-squares fitting of shape components to data, resulting in the tetrad coefficients (                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}tau \$\$                                        {$\tau$}                                                                  ). Our method allows fitting of all four tetrad coefficients together with tetrad-independent~                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$                                        {$\lambda$}                                                                  curvature. We describe the mathematical derivation of the method and two tools to apply the method: the online interactive application BLambdaR, and the Python package pyrolite. We show several case studies that explore aspects of the method, its treatment of redox-anomalous REE, and possible pitfalls and considerations in its use.},

  abstract = {The amount of variance explained is widely reported for quantifying the model fit of a multiple linear regression model. The default adjusted R-squared estimator has the disadvantage of not being unbiased. The theoretically optimal Olkin-Pratt estimator is unbiased. Despite this, it is not being used due to being difficult to compute. In this paper, I present an algorithm for the exact and fast computation of the Olkin-Pratt estimator, which facilitates its use. I compare the Olkin-Pratt, the adjusted R-squared, and 18 alternative estimators using a simulation study. The metrics I use for comparison closely resemble established theoretical optimality properties. Importantly, the exact Olkin-Pratt estimator is shown to be optimal under the standard metric, which considers an estimator optimal if it has the least mean squared error among all unbiased estimators. Under the important alternative metric, which aims for the estimator with the lowest mean squared error, no optimal estimator could be identified. Based on these results, I provide careful recommendations on when to use which estimator, which first and foremost depends on the choice of which metric is deemed most appropriate. If such a choice is infeasible, I recommend using the exact Olkin-Pratt instead of the default adjusted R-squared estimator. To facilitate this, I provide the R package altR2, which implements the Olkin-Pratt estimator as well as all other estimators.},
